Movies Galore!


Our movies app searches for a user-defined movie title using OMDB. If the app is able to locate a movie, it will pull that movie up and provide the user with additional information. The user sees:

- Our "thumbs up/thumbs down" movie review, which shows how many previous users liked and disliked the movie you are viewing
- the poster, cast, release date, and conglomerate online reviews from several review outlets
- a thumbnail from the YouTube trailer, and a link to the YouTube video
- The headline and first paragraph of the New York Times review of the movie from when it first came out, with a link to the New York Times website with that review

Future goals for this project include:

- Incorporating a system that will determine where the user is, and then determine show times for movie theaters around them
- Adding in a forum section for users to discuss various movies
- Making the YouTube trailer into an embedded trailer (youTube appears to have taken steps to ensure that we can't do this)
- Linking movies by things like the director, cast, or sequels (IE link Fast Five to Fate of the Furious)
- Creating a system to recommend movies to users based on other movies that they have enjoyed
